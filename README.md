## Install

The version listed in the default plugin index is different and it's broken,
this fork is meant to fix the install script. Make sure to run the `plugin add`
command using this repo URL as the ref if you'd like to use it, like so:

```bash
asdf plugin add elixir-ls https://github.com/dnery/asdf-elixir-ls
```
